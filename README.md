## Built With

* PHP
* MySQL
* JavaScript
* XML
* C++ (Hardware Communication)

## Prerequisites

* Any OS that supports an installation of [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) with Apache and MySQL
* Google Chrome or Firefox as a web browser

## Installation and Setup

The installation is as simple and is as follows:
* Unzip the master and put its contents into your 'htdocs' folder within your 'XAMPP' installation folder
* Start Apache and MySQL via XAMPP GUI
* Go to phpMyAdmin (default directory is http://localhost/phpmyadmin/)
* Create a username and password combination 'WindAdmin' and 'wind123' with full permissions
* Create an empty database via phpMyAdmin called 'kent_wind'
* Take the kent_wind.sql file and upload it into this empty database
* Visit the page http://localhost/KentWind/visualization.html and watch the visualization
